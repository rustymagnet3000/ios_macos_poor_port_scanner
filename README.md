Port Scanner for iOS and macOS


### The Name of an Operation
Setup one:

- Found Open Ports are stored in a Class NSMutableArray ( singleton ) 
- Class inherits from NSOperation
- The Class represents the smallest unit of work ( the Operation )
- Each Operation is added to a single NSOperationQueue
-After each Operation is finished, it publishes a Notification
- `[queue setMaxConcurrentOperationCount:5];`  makes it multi-threaded


##### Results
A Thread has no permanent linkage to an NSOperation.

[queue setMaxConcurrentOperationCount:5];  makes it multi-threaded

```
NSMutableArray *animalNames = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:     @"Dog",....

do {
    .....
    operation.name = animalNames.lastObject;
    [animalNames removeLastObject];
```
This causes this:
```
